	<h3>How much do I get paid if I refer clients onto your MT5 platform?</h3>
		<div>
			<p>Your earnings are based on the trading done on each referred client’s account:</p>
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr>
						<th>Account type</th>

	<h3>When are my commissions paid?</h3>
		<div>
			<p>Affiliate earnings from your Champion Trader referrals are paid out by the 15th of every month.</p>
			<p>IB earnings from your MT5 referrals are credited instantly into your MT5 account.</p>
		</div>
	<h3>Do you offer any bonus incentives for your IBs?</h3>
		<div>
			<p>Yes, we do. At ChampionFX, we reward our IBs with extra incentives to recognise their hard work. Get your clients to trade more and we will pay more. It’s that simple.</p>
			<p>This is how our IB bonus incentive scheme works:</p>
			<table>
				<thead>
					<tr>
						<th>Total lots traded in a month</th>
						<th>Bonus on monthly total earnings</th>
					</tr>
				</thead>
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<td>300 – 499 lots</td>
						<td>3%</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>500 – 999 lots</td>
						<td>5%</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Over 1,000 lots</td>
						<td>8%</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>
			<p>You bonus is activated when your clients hit a minimum total of lots traded in a month. It is then calculated based on your monthly total earnings from MT5 rebates.</p>
			<p>For e.g. Your clients collectively traded a total of 301 lots last month, earning you a total of USD 1,000 in MT5 rebates. This means that you will receive a 3% bonus on top of your total earnings of USD 1,000 –– which amounts to USD 30.</p>
		</div>	
	<h3>How can I withdraw my commissions?</h3>
		<div>
			<p>Affiliate commissions are credited into your ChampionFX real account by the 15th of every month. You can then withdraw your funds using any of the available withdrawal methods offered to ChampionFX real account holders.</p>
			<p>IB commissions are credited directly into your MT5 account. You can transfer funds from your MT5 account to your ChampionFX real account, then withdraw the funds using any of the available withdrawal methods offered to ChampionFX real account holders.</p>
		</div>
