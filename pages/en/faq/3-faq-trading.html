			<h3>Are you a market maker?</h3>
				<div>
					<p>ChampionFX is a No Dealing Desk (NDD) broker. This means that we work directly with multiple liquidity providers in order to receive the most competitive prices. We also manage our risk and exposure by executing trades directly (where we act as a market maker), or passing them to one of our liquidity providers (LPs).</p>

			<h3>Do I get the same leverage across all account types?</h3>
				<div>
					<p>We offer up to three types of accounts. Each account comes with its own leverage, from 1:100 to 1:1,000.</p>
				</div>
			<h3>How do I place a market order on MT5?</h3>
				<div>
					<p>Placing a market order means that you are instructing your broker to open a position at the current market price. There are several ways to place a market order in MT5.</p>
					<p>You can:</p>
					<ul class="bullet">
						<li>Right-click your chosen instrument in the ‘Market Watch’ window and select ‘New Order’</li>
						<li>Double-click on your chosen instrument in the ‘Market Watch’ window</li>
						<li>Click on ‘Tools’ from the menu on the top left of your screen, and choose ‘New Order’ from the drop-down list</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Any of the above will open the ‘Order’ pop-up window, where you can set the parameters of your order –– including the size of your order, and stop-loss and take-profit levels. You may choose to open a long position or short position by clicking on the ‘Buy by Market’ and ‘Sell by Market’ buttons respectively.</p>
				</div>	
			<h3>How do I place a pending order on MT5?</h3>
				<div>
					<p>A pending order is an order that hasn’t been executed due to instructions to only purchase the order at a predefined price.</p>
					<p>To place a pending order, you will start by placing a new market order as usual. However, you will need to change the ‘Type’ of the order to ‘Pending Order’, and then set the parameters of your pending order, including its expiry date and time.</p>
				</div>
			<h3>How do I modify or delete a pending order on MT5?</h3>
				<div>
					<p>If you’ve placed a pending order, and now wish to modify or delete it, this is how you can do it:</p>
					<ul class="bullet">
						<li>Find the pending order in the ‘Terminal’ window</li>
						<li>Double-click or right-click on the pending order to open the ‘Order’ pop-up window</li>
						<li>Modify the parameters of the order (including expiry date and stop-loss level), or delete the order</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Please note that pending orders usually appear below your open orders in the ‘Terminal’ window.</p>

			<h3>What are the differences between a fixed and variable spread?</h3>
				<div>
					<p>The spread is essentially the buy and sell prices of an asset. A broker may offer a fixed or variable spread, or both.</p>
					<p>A fixed spread is a spread value that stays the same, no matter the time or market volatility. A floating spread is a constantly changing spread value, defined by real-world events and market volatility.</p>
					<p>At ChampionFX, we offer both fixed and variable spreads depending on your account.</p>
				</div>
			<h3>What are the differences between instant and market execution?</h3>
				<div>
					<p>ChampionFX offers both instant and market execution, depending on the type of account you’ve chosen.</p>
					<p>With instant execution, you are able to place an order at the best price available at the current time. With market execution, you place an order at the price set by the broker.</p>
				</div>	
			<h3>Do you have restrictions on trading robots and strategies for any ChampionFX account?</h3>
				<div>
					<p>ChampionFX welcomes all types of trading robots and strategies onto the platform and will not place any restrictions on your trading, unless unethical trading practices have been uncovered.</p>
				</div>	
			<h3>How are swap rates applied?</h3>
				<div>
					<p>Swap rates are also known as overnight funding – where your account will incur the cost required to keep any positions open.</p>
					<p>The swap rate is based on interbank lending rates, on top of a 2% fee.</p>
					<p>Additionally, positions that are still open on Wednesday at 23:59:59 GMT will be charged three times the swap rate to account for weekends.</p>
				</div>	
			<h3>What kind of spreads do you offer?</h3>
				<div>
					<p>ChampionFX offers a fixed spread for our Cent account, and variable spreads for our Standard and STP accounts. All account types are commission-free.</p>
				</div>		
			<h3>What is leverage?</h3>
				<div>
					<p>Leverage is the ability for you to control a large amount of money using minimal capital.</p>
					<p>Essentially, when you invest in something, your broker will ask you to put up a certain amount of capital that’s a fraction of the total value available to you, and lend you the rest.</p>
					<p>For example, if you deposited a capital of USD 50 with a broker offering a leverage of 1:1,000, you will have USD 50,000 (the margin) available to trade with.</p>
				</div>	
			<h3>What is your maximum leverage?</h3>
				<div>
					<p>ChampionFX offers three types of accounts. Each account comes with its own maximum leverage:</p>
					<ul class="bullet">
						<li>Cent account – maximum leverage up to 1:1,000</li>
						<li>Standard account – maximum leverage up to 1:300</li>
						<li>STP account – maximum leverage up to 1:100</li>
					</ul>
				</div>	
			<h3>What is margin?</h3>
				<div>
					<p>Margin is the amount of money required by your broker to open a new position. Brokers use margin to decide if you have adequate balance in your account to cover your order. Margin is determined by the asset you’re trading and the size of your position.</p>
				</div>		
			<h3>What is a margin call and how does it affect my open positions?</h3>
				<div>
					<p>A margin call is a situation where your account is unable to cover the margin requirements.</p>
				</div>	
			<h3>What is a stop out?</h3>
				<div>
					<p>A stop out level is the point where you are unable to maintain an open position. As a result, all your pending orders will be deleted and your open positions are forcibly closed. This is due to insufficient margin in your account balance.</p>

			<h3>Where can I find a list of all the MT5 financial instruments that you offer, plus their contract specifications?</h3>
				<div>
					<p>Please refer to the contract specifications for each market:</p>
					<ul class="bullet">
						<li><a href="https://www.champion-fx.com/en/forex.html#contract-spec">Forex</a></li>
						<li><a href="https://www.champion-fx.com/en/metals.html#metals-contract-specs">Metals</a></li>
						<li><a href="https://www.champion-fx.com/en/cfd.html#indices-cfd-contract-specs">CFDs</a></li>
					</ul>
				</div>	
			<h3>How do you read a currency pair?</h3>
				<div>
					<p>Here’s a simple way of looking at currency pairs, using the EUR/USD as an example:</p>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-sm">
							<div class="txt-right lg-padding">
								<h3>EUR</h3>
								<h4>Base currency</h4>
								<p>Also known as transaction currency</p>
							</div>
						</div>
						<div class="separator-vertical primary-color"></div>
						<div class="col-sm">
							<div class="lg-padding">
								<h3>USD</h3>
								<h4>Quote currency</h4>
								<p>Also known as counter currency</p>
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
					<p>In this example, the EUR is the base currency, and it is always equal to one unit.</p>
					<p>The price of the EUR/USD currency pair (e.g. EUR/USD = 1.05229) means that one EUR is equal to USD 1.05229. This means that if you wanted to buy one EUR, you would have to sell USD 1.05229.</p>
				</div>	
			<h3>What is a Contract for Difference (CFD)?</h3>
				<div>
					<p>A Contract for Difference (CFD) is a financial instrument that allows you to potentially profit by speculating on the rise and fall of an underlying asset. It is essentially a contract between you and the broker –– and you do not actually own the asset you are speculating on.</p>
					<p>A CFD is similar to a binary option in the sense that they are essentially contracts between you and a broker. You do not actually own the underlying asset.</p>
				</div>	
			<h3>What are binary options?</h3>
				<div>
					<p>A binary option is a type of financial option with a fixed payout. This means that you always know what you stand to gain or lose before you purchase the option.</p>
					<p>It is called a ‘binary’ option because there can only be two outcomes: if your prediction is successful, you will receive the fixed payout. If you lose, you only forfeit your initial stake.</p>
				</div>	
			<h3>What’s the difference between the currency pairs offered on your MT5 platform versus the currency pairs offered on your Champion Trader platform?</h3>
				<div>
					<p>Our MT5 platform lets you trade directly in the Foreign Exchange Market (Forex) where you will speculate on the value of one currency over the currency that it’s paired with –– all in an attempt to make a profit from the difference.</p>
					<p>Our Champion Trader platform lets you trade binary option contracts on currency pairs. These contracts come with fixed risks and payouts that are tied to the performance of the underlying asset, of which there can only be two outcomes –– either the price of the asset will go up or down.</p>
