<p>Execute your trades automatically by using trading robots and trading signals.</p>
<h2>Algorithmic trading</h2>
<p>Algorithmic trading is also known as automated trading, where you use applications known as trading robots to automatically analyse and execute your trades for you. Trading robots are also known as Expert Advisors or EAs.</p>
<p>Purchase or rent trading robots from the MetaTrader Market and download them directly to your MT5 platform. You can even test them for free before you decide to purchase.</p>

<p>If you have an idea for a unique trading robot, you can even hire a developer from the MQL5 Freelance market to build one for you.</p>
<h2>Copy trading</h2>
<p>Use the trading signals service to copy the trading operations of a more experienced trader. When you subscribe to a signal, the same trades will be automatically executed on your account.</p>
<p>You can become a signal provider if you want to share your trades with others, whether for free or a fee.</p>
