<p>Here at ChampionFX, we take that extra step to protect you. Here are a few guidelines to secure your data and to stay safe online.</p>
<h2>Suspicious content</h2>
<p>Don't click links in suspicious emails, SMSes, or pop-ups. Always type the web address yourself. The correct URL is www.champion-fx.com.</p>
<h2>Login ID and password</h2>
<p>Never share valuable information such as your login ID and password via emails, texts or phone calls.</p>
<h2>Unsolicited promotional emails</h2>
<p>Never respond to unsolicited promotional emails. If in doubt, just delete the email.</p>
<h2>Secure connection</h2>
<p>Check out the padlock icon on your browser. This icon indicates that the website uses a secure connection.</p>
<h2>Device security</h2>
<p>Invest in device security such as a personal firewall, anti-spyware, or antivirus software. Update this software regularly!</p>
<h2>Share with trusted sources</h2>
<p>Share your e-mail address with only trusted sources. Only your family, friends, and trusted business contacts should have your personal e-mail address. Do not post your e-mail address on forums, or in public chat rooms.</p>
<h2>Use separate email accounts</h2>
<p>Imagine if you could consolidate all of your work emails into a single work account and all of your personal communications with your personal account, and a throwaway account for potential spam links. This way, if someone hacks your work account, all of your personal emails are still safe or vice versa.</p>
<h2>Create smart and strong passwords</h2>
<p>Make it difficult for hackers to crack your password. You may create a smart password by incorporating capital letters, numbers, special characters and using more than six characters.
