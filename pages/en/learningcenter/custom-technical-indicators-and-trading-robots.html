<p>Develop your own technical indicators and trading robots that range from the simple to the complex.</p>
<h2>How to develop your own technical indicators and trading robots for MetaTrader 5</h2>
<p>A technical indicator is the most important tool used in technical analysis. Some of the most popular indicators are available for free, and they come pre-built into the MetaTrader 5 platform. They are used to help you study charts of financial instruments and identify patterns in price movement so you can adapt your trading strategy according to market trends.</p>
<p>A trading robot is used to automatically analyse and execute trades on your behalf based on a preset algorithm.</p>
<p>There are two ways to get your hands on a custom technical indicator or trading robot:</p>
<ul class="bullet">
	<li>Freelance – Advertise in the MQL5 Freelance section to get a professional developer to build it for you for a fee.</li>
	<li>MQL5 – Develop your own by using the MQL5 programming language. The MQL5 integrated development environment (IDE) provides you with all the tools you need, including a text editor, strategy tester, comprehensive documentation, and more.</li>
</ul>
<h2>MQL5 Wizard</h2>
<p>If you’re looking to build a trading robot quickly and easily, you can also try the MQL5 Wizard that lets you build one without having to write a single line of code. All you need to do is specify the desired parameters and select the necessary component, then let the MQL5 Wizard compile them into a working application. You can then test it using a demo account to see if it works as intended.</p>
