Introducing the MQL5 Wizard for MetaTrader 5, your ultimate tool for easy application and bot development.

The idea behind the MQL5 Wizard is to allow traders with no programming experience to easily create Expert Advisors (EAs) that can work on MT5  –– software applications that allow you to automatically execute your trading strategies without the interference of human emotions. When it comes to ease of use, the MQL5 Wizard does an exceptional job of taking inputs then creating a workable robot for your own use.

The MQL Wizard comes with multiple preset packages that can be combined together with the click of a button. With the MQL5 Wizard, every trader can construct trading robots based on their preferences. the only thing needed is to specify the desired parameters and select the necessary components. The wizard will do all the rest.

You can also sell the EAs you’ve made in the MetaTrader Market, allowing you to create a business out of your own product.
