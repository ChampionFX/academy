### Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the US dollar is unchanged over the last two days despite disappointing Philly Fed Manufacturing data yesterday. 

The euro continues to underperform as French elections loom this weekend. Markets are starting to price in success for eurosceptic candidates, putting pressure on French bonds and the euro on top of yesterday's Paris terror attack. 

Meanwhile, the pound continues to perform well following the snap election announcement, with most sterling pairs topping the best performer charts this week. 


### Coming up today

Coming up today, we have a series of European Flash manufacturing and services PMI data, starting with French data at 07.00, followed by German at 07.30 and EU wide at 08.00. 

At 08.30, we get UK retail sales. MPC member Saunders speaks at 11.45. 

At 12.30, we get Canadian CPI. 

FOMC member Kashkari speaks at 13.30. 

US existing home sales follow at 14.00.


### Trade Idea

A positive result this weekend for pro-eu candidates in the French election could spark a relief rally in the euro. However, there still remains the outsize chance of an anti-establishment result and given everything we've seen in the last year, it could pay to bet on a shock.
