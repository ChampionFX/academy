### Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the US dollar is up slightly after a negative session yesterday. The dollar dropped after Fed Chair Yellenâ€™s speech yesterday which appeared to scale back prospects for further rate rises this year.

The yen pairs are uniformly lower, with the EUR/JPY extending its consistent downswing. The EUR/JPY is now set for its eighth downtrend in ten sessions.

The EUR/GBP is also slipping lower alongside the EUR/USD as tensions mount over French elections.

The USD/CAD is unmoved after plunging lower yesterday as oil prices surged.

### Coming up today

Coming up today, we have UK CPI at 08.30, released alongside PPI and RPI.

German ZEW economic sentiment follows at 09.00.

US JOLTS job openings are at 14.00.

### Trade Idea

The EUR/JPY consistent downtrend is hard to ignore and more downside could be on the cards.
