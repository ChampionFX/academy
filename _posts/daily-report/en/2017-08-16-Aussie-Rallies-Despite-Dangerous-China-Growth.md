### Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning the Australian dollar remains the power player after the IMF predicted faster growth for China, albeit fuelled by dangerous levels of debt. Australian pairs are rallying this morning while other dollar pairs falter. 

After a below par set of inflation figures yesterday, the British pound slumped against most currencies. The EUR/GBP is on the rise as a result, extending its recent up-trend. 

The dollar pairs are generally flat to negative this morning after yesterday's better than expected Empire State Manufacturing Index and retail sales. 

The yen pairs are on the rise, led by the AUD/JPY, as the USD/JPY extends its recent rebound.
