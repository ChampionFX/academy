### Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, markets remain on guard after the US S&P 500 experienced its largest declines in three months. The Barcelona terror attack and Trump turmoil are all playing a part. Demand for the yen has surged, helping the USD/JPY push lower, while the US dollar is nudging higher this morning. 

Most yen pairs with the exception of the USD/JPY are staging a counter rally this morning after yesterday's slump. 

The euro is under-performing again today after selling off on yesterday's ECB comments which expressed concern over the strength of the euro and the impact of this. 

Dollar pairs are generally performing well, led by the GBP/ USD. 

Gold testing the August highs yesterday, but is slipping back slightly this morning. 

### Coming up today

Today, we have Canadian CPI at 13.30. 

At 15.00, we get US preliminary UoM consumer sentiment.
