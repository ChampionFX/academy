### Morning Report: 07.00 London

The US dollar index is on the rise again this morning, putting pressure on the main dollar pairs.

Meanwhile, the yen pairs are on the back foot as the yen gathers strength.

The biggest yen loser is the AUD/JPY as the Aussie slips back further this week, down 1.53% on the week. The pound remains under pressure though, down 1.67% on the week.

Gold has made some healthy moves higher this week though, despite the dollar’s weakness this morning.

### Coming up today

Coming up today, we have UK construction PMI at 08.30.

This is followed by RBA governor Lowe speaking at 09.15.

At 12.30, we get US and Canadian trade balance.

At 14.00, we get US factory orders.

ECB President Draghi speaks at 14.30.

### Trade Idea

The Australian dollar is showing some inherent weakness and this is not helped by this morning’s dovish RBA statement.
