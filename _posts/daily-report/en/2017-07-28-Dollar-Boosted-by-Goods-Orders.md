### Morning Report: 07.00 London

The dollar remains on top this morning after strong gains yesterday. These gains are in part being driven by yesterday's better than expected durable goods orders.

A big mover over the last few days has been the Swiss franc which has fallen hard since Wednesday, with gains for the USD/CHF and EUR/CHF. 

The dollar pairs are mixed this morning after a wide sell-off yesterday, the GBP/USD is threatening small gains, while the EUR/USD is unchanged. 

Commodity currencies have a negative bias with the Australian and Canadian dollars.

The yen pairs are also on the back foot, with the USD/JPY on the defensive as the yen out paces the dollar.
