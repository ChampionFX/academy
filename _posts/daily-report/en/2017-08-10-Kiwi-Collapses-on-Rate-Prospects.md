### Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the New Zealand dollar is the big mover after comments from RBNZ officials which stated that the Kiwi "does need to adjust down". The NZD/USD is down by over 1.00% so far. 

Elsewhere, the dollar pairs are slipping lower though by a lesser margin than the Kiwi. The AUD/USD is sliding again, with the GBP/USD on track to be down for five of the last six days. 

Yen pairs are following suit, with the likes of the GBP/JPY extending losing runs. 

The USD/CHF is pushing up this morning after its biggest single day move since 2015. 

Gold continues to rise this morning as investors seek out safe havens.
