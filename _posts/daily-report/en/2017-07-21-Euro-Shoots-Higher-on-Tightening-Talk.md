### Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the euro is holding yesterday's gains after ECB chair Mario Draghi outlined plans that have been seen as the start of the tightening phase. 

The EUR/GBP remains at the highs as the pound struggles amid Brexit negotiation blockages. 

Meanwhile, the Australian dollar has come off the highs, with the AUD/USD one of the big losers this morning. 

The NZD/USD is storming higher by contrast. 

The USD/JPY is slipping lower again as the yen regains regional control. 

### Coming up today

This morning, we have UK public sector net borrowing at 09.30. 

We have a Canadian focus at 13.30 with CPI and retail sales.
