### Morning Report: 07.00 London

The US dollar remains in control after the release of bullish US FOMC meeting minutes.

The move is putting pressure on dollar pairs, with the AUD/USD selling off in particular.

The USD/JPY is back on the rise after further selling yesterday. Yen pairs generally remain under pressure, with the AUD/JPY selling off again this morning.

### Coming up today

Coming up today at 11.30, we have the release of the ECB monetary policy meeting accounts.

At 12.30, we have Canadian building permits, released alongside unemployment claims.

ECB president Draghi speaks at 20.00.

### Trade Idea

The AUD/JPY has been a consistent loser of late and it could well pay to ride this trend lower.
