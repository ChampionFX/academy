### Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the Australian dollar is building on Friday's gains and leading markets higher despite China disappointing in its industrial production data. 

Yen pairs are generally on the rise as they rebound against the pressure of the last week, building on Friday's promise. 

The USD/CHF is rising, as a general sign of market ease over the North Korea situation. 

Gold is slipping lower on a similar trend.

Dollar pairs are generally on the back foot however, with the likes of the EUR/USD and GBP/USD reversing Friday's gains. 

### Coming up today

Coming up today, we have European industrial production data at 10.00.
