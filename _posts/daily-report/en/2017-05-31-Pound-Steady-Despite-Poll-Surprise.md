### Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the pound is steadier than expected after a poll published in the Times but the UK general election as being closer than previously expected. There was strong interest for the pound yesterday however, with the EUR/GBP reversing Monday's gain. 

The dollar is marginally higher this morning, but not by enough to break the trends of the last week or so, especially on the USD/JPY which remains firmly in a down trend. 

The NZD/USD is now unchanged after reaching higher levels earlier in the session. The Aussie has a small negative bias. 

Gold is now off for the third day in a row.

European CPI flash estimate follows at 10.00. 

FOMC member Kaplan speaks at 13.00.
