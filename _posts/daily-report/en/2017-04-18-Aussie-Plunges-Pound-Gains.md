### Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the US dollar remains on the front foot despite speculation that Trumpâ€™s tax reforms will take longer to implement due to the failure to pass the healthcare bill. The geopolitical tensions around North Korea are also playing a part.

Most yen pairs are unchanged this morning after strong gains yesterday across the board. The AUD/JPY is weak though.

The Australian dollar is under performing across its various pairings. This follows the release of the last monetary policy meeting minutes. The AUD/JPY is now down nearly 3% for April.

The British pound is performing well by contrast, with the GBP/JPY up 0.89%.

### Coming up today

Coming up today, we have US building permits at 12.30, released alongside US housing starts.

At 13.15, we have US capacity utilisation rates and industrial production.
