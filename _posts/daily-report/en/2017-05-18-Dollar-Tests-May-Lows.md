### Morning Report: 07.00 London

The dollar sunk hard yesterday, but is at least stable this morning as stock markets and currencies move in line with troubles around Trump's Presidency. 

The USD/JPY saw some of the biggest moves yesterday to the downside, but is recovering somewhat this morning. 

Other yen pairs are following suit, with the AUD/JPY rebounding sharply after better than expected employment figures. 

Dollar pairs have a negative bias this morning, with the likes of the EUR/USD unwinding yesterday's gains.

### Coming up today

Coming up today, we have UK retail sales at 08.30. 

This is followed by unemployment claims at 12.30 and Philly Fed Manufacturing Index at the same time. 

ECB President Draghi speaks at 17.00. 

### Trade Idea

The USD/JPY has a good run from mid April, but the downtrend for 2017 remains largely intact. 

There could be further downside from here and a good way to play this is a lOWER trade predicting that the USD/JPY will TOUCH 108.25 within the next 40 days for a potential return of 124%
