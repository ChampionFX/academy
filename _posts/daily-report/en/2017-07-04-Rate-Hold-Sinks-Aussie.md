### Morning Report: 07.00 London

The Australian dollar is selling off heavily this morning after the RBA opted to put rates on hold. This and the accompanying statement slashed expectations for rate hikes in coming months, sending the AUD/USD and AUD/JPY tumbling. 

The dollar pairs are also struggling, with the likes of the GBP/USD and EUR/USD on the back foot as the US dollar regains control. 

The yen pairs are dancing to the same tune, with the USD/JPY slipping lower. 

Gold and silver continue to struggle in the face of the dollar's renewed strength. 

### Coming up today

Coming up today, we have UK Construction PMI at 09.30

Today is a Bank Holiday in honour of Independence Day
