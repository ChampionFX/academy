### Morning Report: 07.00 London

The Australian dollar and the New Zealand dollars are on the back foot this morning after credit agencies downgraded China's rating. With its strong reliance on China, it doesn't take much for the Australian dollar to catch a Chinese cold.

Elsewhere, the US dollar is rising after a moderately positive reaction to Trump's budget. 

The euro and pound are on the back foot. 

The EUR/GBP is on the back foot as the euro continues to under-perform despite strong German Ifo business climate data yesterday.
