### Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the dollar index is recovering after yesterday's jobs induced sell-off. ADP payrolls came in below expectations, with unemployment claims rising. Manufacturing came in above estimates however. All eyes will be on today's NFP jobs report though. 

Most dollar pairs with the exception of the AUD/USD made strong gains yesterday as the dollar backed off. The EUR/USD in particular pushed higher, erasing most of the week's losses. Dollar pairs are on the back foot again this morning though. 

The yen pairs are making gains this morning, led by the AUD/JPY.  

### Coming up today

Today, we have UK manufacturing production at 09.30, alongside UK goods trade balance. 

At 13.30, we have the main event - US Non Farm Employment change, released alongside the unemployment rate and average hourly earnings. 

Canadian jobs data is also released at 13.30. 

We get the Fed monetary policy report at 16.00.
