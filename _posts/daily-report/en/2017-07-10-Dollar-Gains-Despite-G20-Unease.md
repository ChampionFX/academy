### Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the dollar index is on the rise, and the dollar pairs are generally softer despite G20 unease over a divisive approach from the US. 

Most dollar pairs are showing minor losses, with positive trends from recent sessions still largely intact. 

The yen pairs are pushing higher by contrast, led by the GBP/JPY which is up 0.45%. 

The pound is out-performing today after suffering heavy losses on Friday on the back of dire manufacturing figures.

Gold and silver continue to slump despite indifferent trading from the dollar. 

### Coming up today

It is a quiet day today, with Sentix Investor Confidence an item of note.
