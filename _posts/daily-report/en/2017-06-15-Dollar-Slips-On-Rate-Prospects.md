### Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the US dollar remains soft following yesterday's FOMC meeting. As expected, the Fed raised rates by 0.25%, but from there, the future appears less hawkish than previously anticipated. The US dollar index saw some wild swings yesterday, but ultimately finished lower. 

The dollar pairs finished higher yesterday, though most were some way off the highs. This morning, there is a positive bias for the likes of the EUR/USD and GBP/USD, but gains are marginal so far. 

The AUD/USD has been the big winner over the last two days, extending recent gains. 

By contrast, the NZD/USD is on the back foot, though still higher than yesterday's open. 

Gold also continues to retreat.
