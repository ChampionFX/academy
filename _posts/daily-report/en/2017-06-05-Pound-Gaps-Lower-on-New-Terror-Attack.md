### Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the pound is trading lower as markets react to the third UK terror strike of 2017. The EUR/GBP has slipped lower, while the GBP/ USD has gapped lower. The GBP/JPY is trading slightly higher, but lagging other yen pairs. 

The yen pairs generally have a positive bias, as a small counter move to Friday's heavy selling. 

The US dollar index gapped higher at the open, but has since been slipping lower to the unchanged mark.  

The dollar pairs are mixed, with the Australian dollar leading the pack after company operating profits rose more than expected. The US dollar itself may be subdued until the FOMC meeting this week. 

### Coming up today

Coming up today, we have UK services PMI at 09.30. 

This is followed by revised US non farm productivity at 13.30. 

US ISM non-manufacturing PMI follows at 15.00, with factors orders at the same time.
