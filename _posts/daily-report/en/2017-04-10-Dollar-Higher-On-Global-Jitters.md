### Morning Report: 07.00 London

Markets are mixed this morning after a weekend of global jitters over Trumpâ€™s Syria intervention and the big meeting with China. The US dollar has nudged higher, putting pressure on dollar pairs.

The AUD/USD has extended its downtrend, while the EUR/USD gapped lower but is recovering.

The yen pairs are generally higher, with the GBP/JPY leading the charge.

### Coming up today

Coming up today, we have US Fed Chair Yellen speaking at 20.10.

### Trade Idea

The EUR/USD has continued to struggle in the face of a strong US dollar.

This could continue as French elections cause uncertainty across the region.
