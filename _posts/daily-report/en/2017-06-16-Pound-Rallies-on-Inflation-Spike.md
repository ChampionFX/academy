### Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the British pound remains strong after yesterday's revelation that the Bank of England had closer than expected to raising interest rates. A feared inflation spike is thought to be behind this move, helping the EUR/GBP to trade lower and the GBP/JPY to push higher. 

Meanwhile, the USD/JPY continues to trade higher as the dollar takes control following better than expected manufacturing data. 

The euro came in for some heavy selling yesterday as another Greek debt deal was released that punted the problem into the long grass. 

The Australian dollar is trading in line with other pairs this morning after the AUD/JPY rocketed higher yesterday. 

### Coming up today

Coming up today, we have final European CPI at 09.00. 

At 13.30, we get Canadian foreign securities purchases as well as US building permits and housing starts. 

At 15.00, we have US UoM consumer sentiment. 

FOMC member Kaplan speaks at 17.45.
