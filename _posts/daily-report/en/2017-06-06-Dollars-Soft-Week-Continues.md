### Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the US dollar has dropped further on expectation of further negative news of the US economy after US ISM non manufacturing PMI came out slightly lower than expected. Worse still, US productivity figures came in below expectations. 

The biggest moves are being seen on the yen pairs this morning as the rising yen and weak dollar drags the likes of the USD/JPY lower. 

The pound was steady yesterday as markets reacted to the terror strike and shrugged off poor UK services PMI. 

Gold is extending its rally seen since May 11th and is now set to challenge the April highs.

The AUD/USD is trading higher after the RBA opted to keep rates unchanged at 1.50%.  

### Coming up today

Coming up today, we have Canadian Ivey PMI at 15.00. 

At the same time, we get US JOLTS job opening.
