### Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the US dollar remains soft after yesterday's below par building permits and housing starts. In addition, Fed minutes showed that policy makers were concerned about weak inflation. 

The weak dollar is helping the dollar pairs to push higher. Most are flat to positive this morning, but there were big gains yesterday, led by the AUD/USD and NZD/USD.

Elsewhere, the USD/CAD slumped lower as the US dollar stepped off the gas. 

The EUR/ GBP is flat so far today, but extended its recent winning run recently.
