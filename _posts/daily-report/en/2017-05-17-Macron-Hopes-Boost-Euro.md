### Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the euro is maintaining its out-performance as markets gain confidence from French President Marcon's first few meetings. The EUR/USD made solid gains yesterday and is up again this morning. The EUR/GBP is a little more subdued today though as the pound recovers. 

The US dollar index is continuing its reversal, partly hurt by the latest Trump troubles and partly on the back of house price falls. 

The yen pairs are all lower, as money flows away from the dollar and into the yen. 

Dollar pairs are generally higher, though the Aussie continues to lag. 

Gold is unchanged this morning after posting strong gains yesterday.

Coming up today, we have UK average earnings index, claimant count change and unemployment claims at 08.30. 

At 09.00, we get final European CPI. 

Canadian manufacturing sales follows at 12.30.
