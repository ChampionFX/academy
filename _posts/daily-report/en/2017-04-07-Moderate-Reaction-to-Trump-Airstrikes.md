### Morning Report: 07.00 London

Last night Donald Trump ordered air strikes against Syria as a response to chemical attacks against innocent civilians. Markets have seen a slight shift towards safe havens, but the reaction has been more muted than expected. Questions have been raised as to the impact of the strikes and the perception is that they have been more about ‘sending a message’ both at home and abroad.

Gold has been the big winner, with the precious metal heading back to the highs.

The dollar is making small losses, with the USD/JPY also on the back foot.

The Australian dollar has continued its slump with further selling in the AUD/USD this morning.

### Coming up today

Markets appear more concerned with the US jobs report due out later today.

Coming up today, we have UK manufacturing production at 08.30, released alongside goods trade balance.

BOE governor Carney speaks at 09.00.

At 12.30, we get the all important NFP jobs report from the US, released alongside average earnings and the unemployment rate.

Canadian employment data is released at the same time.

### Trade Idea

US airstrikes have only strengthen the flow of money into the perceived safety of the yen.

The euro continues to look wobbly and this could mean further downside from here.
