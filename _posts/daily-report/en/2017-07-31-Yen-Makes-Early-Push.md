### Morning Report: 07.00 London

As we enter the final trading day of the month, the Japanese yen is in control, helping the USD/JPY and other yen pairs drift lower this morning. The majority of yen pairs gapped lower at the open, but those early moves have since been partially reversed. 

The dollar pairs are generally on the back foot so far this morning, but the long term bullish trends that we have seen since April remain intact. 

The USD/CAD has seen one of the biggest moves, with the USD/CAD gapping higher despite Friday's big move lower on oil prices. 

Gold is also on the back foot, but the mid-June surge remains on track. 

### Coming up today

This is followed by European CPI data at 10.00.
