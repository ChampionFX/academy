### Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the British pound remains relatively strong ahead of today's MPC meeting where no change is expected. The GBP/JPY is off the highs, but the up trend remains largely in place. 

The USD/JPY and US dollar index are both slipping back after strong performances this week. 

The NZD/USD remains weak after the RBNZ's decision to keep rates unchanged, with a dovish forward outlook. 

The USD/CAD's uptrend is getting back on track, helped by the renewed weakness in oil prices.

Coming up today, we have UK manufacturing production at 08.30, released alongside Goods trade balance. 

At 09.00, we get EU Economic Forecasts.
