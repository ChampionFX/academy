### Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the US dollar is continuing to back off, helping the dollar pairs to post mild gains this morning. 

The NZD/USD is amongst the top performers, rising for the third day in a row.

The AUD/USD following suit, but the EUR/USD is slightly negative after posting large gains on Friday. 

Meanwhile, the yen pairs are climbing after two days of losses despite lower than expected Chinese industrial production.


### Coming up today

Coming up today, we have the US Empire state manufacturing index at 12.30.

Theresa May speaks at 19.00.


### Trade Idea

The USD/JPY is back on the rise this morning, with the previous two sessions hardly denting the uptrend since mid April.

Further upside is on the cards and a good way to play this, is a HIGHER trade predicting that the USD/JPY will close above 114.00 in 14 days, for a potential return of 133%
