### Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the US dollar is continuing to back off, helping the dollar pairs to post mild gains this morning. 

The NZD/USD is amongst the top performers, rising for the third day in a row.

The AUD/USD following suit, but the EUR/USD is slightly negative after posting large gains on Friday. 

Meanwhile, the yen pairs are climbing after two days of losses despite lower than expected Chinese industrial production.


### Coming up today

Coming up today, we have the US Empire state manufacturing index at 12.30.

Theresa May speaks at 19.00.


### Trade Idea

The USD/JPY is back on the rise this morning, with the previous two sessions hardly dentingn the uptrend since mid April.

This may be cause for concern, but the real driver of all the GBP/JPY recently has been the general out performance of yen pairs. This trend appears largely intact, so betting on further GBP/JPY upside could pay off.
