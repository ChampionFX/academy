### Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the euro is slipping back after day's of gains. This comes on the back of the losses for the EUR/USD yesterday. The EUR/GBP also looks to be on the turn. 

While the euro subsides, the pound continues to enjoy gains this week on market friendly election hopes. 

Meanwhile, the Australian dollar is back on the rise after heavy losses yesterday. 

The yen pairs are mixed after gains made throughout the week. 

Gold slipping lower this morning, keeping the general theme of bullishness.


### Coming up today

Coming up today, we have RBA governor Lowe speaking at 09.10. 

At 11.45, we get the ECB's minimum bid rate. The press conference follows at 12.30.

Also at 12.30, we get US core durable goods and unemployment claims.


### Trade Idea

The EUR/GBP is turning back this morning as Monday's election rally turns back.

There could be further downside from here before the final round of French elections.
