### Morning Report: 07.00 London

The dollar index hit reverse gear yesterday, with follow-on selling this morning. This comes ahead of an expected dovish tone from Janet Yellen's testimony today. 

The dollar pairs are mixed, with the AUD/USD continuing to rise, but the GBP/USD sinking for its fourth day in a row. 

The EUR/GBP is soaring higher as the weak pound meets the resurgent euro. The pair is hitting its highest levels since November 2016. 

The USD/JPY is slipping lower, as the yen regains control, with the GBP/JPY dropping heavily for the second day in a row. 

Gold is on the rise, gaining for the third day in a row. 

### Coming up today

Today we have UK average earnings at 09.30, released alongside claimant count change and the unemployment rate. 

At 15.00, we get the Canadian BOC monetary policy report and statement. 

Fed Chair Yellen also speaks at 15.00. 

Crude oil inventories follow at 15.30. 

The Canadian BOC press conference follows at 16.15.
