### Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the dollar remains strong as the latest Fed minutes showed that policymakers were ready to press ahead with the unwinding of stimulus packages. 

The Australian dollar remains on the back foot, alongside the euro, but the pound is strong this morning, helping the GBP/USD to rise. 

The EUR/GBP is falling as the euro loses ground to the out-performing pound. 

The USD/CAD has risen as oil prices slump overnight. 

The yen pairs are mixed, with most on the slide, but the GBP/JPY rising.
