### Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the dollar index is steady after heavy selling on Friday. This negative came on the back of a poor set of US economic data points. Inflation, retail sales and preliminary UoM consumer sentiment all dropped more than expected. 

The dollar pairs are on the back foot this morning, but there is some way to go to reverse Friday's gains. The AUD/USD saw the biggest gains on Friday, while the EUR/USD lagged. 

The USD/JPY is also on the rise this morning after dropping on Friday. By contrast, the AUD/JPY made small gains on Friday and is up again this morning. 

The EUR/GBP has come unstuck these last few days, though is showing some fight this morning. 

Gold enjoyed gains on Friday, though is unchanged this morning. 

### Coming up today

Coming up today, we have final European CPI at 10.00. 

At 13.30, we have Canadian foreign securities purchases and US Empire State Manufacturing Index.
