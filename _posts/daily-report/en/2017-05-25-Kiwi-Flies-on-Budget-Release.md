### Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the New Zealand dollar is the leading light after a positive reaction to the annual budget release this morning. 

The AUD/USD is also performing well as positive noises from China filter through. 

The US dollar is generally softer after last night's FOMC meeting minutes showed that the Fed were firm on holding rates at their last meeting, while analysts expect a rate rise in June. 

The USD/JPY and other yen pairs are on the rise, capping a chopping week. 

The EUR/GBP is on the back foot slightly after a generally up and down week that has seen the advantage move to the euro. 

### Coming up today

At 09.30, we have UK second estimate GPD and preliminary business investment. 

At 13.30, we have US unemployment claims. 

FOMC member Brainard speaks at 15.00.
