### Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the dollar is on the front foot as President Trump fires a warning shot over the Nuclear threat from North Korea.

The USD/JPY is following suit and nudging higher, after heavy selling on Friday.

Elsewhere, the euro has jumped higher on potentially market friendly French Presidential election polls. This does come on the back of a week of heavy selling for the euro, with the EUR/GBP suffering three days of heavy selling. It was also reported over the weekend that central bankers were preferring the stability of sterling over the euro.

The AUD/USD has also struggled of late and is one of the worst performers this morning.

### Coming up today

Coming up today, we have UK manufacturing PMI at 08.30.

This is followed by US ISM manufacturing PMI at 14.00.

At 14.30, we get BOC business outlook survey data.

FOMC member Dudley speaks at 14.30.
