### Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, markets are relatively quiet, with some yen pairs extending the recent downtrend. Yesterday, the yen pairs saw strong selling across the board, led by the AUD/JPY and EUR/JPY.
The AUD/JPY remains weak, with the pair off 1.45%

Gold is flying high as investors seek out safer havens and the dollar adjusts its pace.

The dollar pairs enjoyed strong gains yesterday, with the GBP/USD on the rise. The EUR/USD made gains but lagged other dollar pairs.

### Coming up today

Coming up today, we have UK BOE governor Carney speaking at 08.00.

At 08.30, we have UK average earnings index, released alongside claimant count change and the unemployment rate.

At 10.00, President Trump speaks.

At 12.30, we have US import prices.

Then at 14.00, we have the Canadian BOC monetary policy report and overnight rate. BOC governor Poloz speaks at 08.15.

At 14.30, we get US crude oil inventories.

### Trade Idea

The yen pairs suffered significant losses yesterday, but with the dollar falling behind the pace, we could well see even further losses for the likes of the AUD/JPY in coming days.
