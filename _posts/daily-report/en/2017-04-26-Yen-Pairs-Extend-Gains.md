### Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the yen pairs are extending their gains as investors embrace risk with US markets breaching new highs. 

The US dollar index is up slightly as US companies report positive gains. 

Elsewhere, the euro continues to make waves, with the EUR/JPY up over 4% on the week. 

The Australian and New Zealand dollar are lagging though, with the NZD/USD down 0.37%. This comes after Australian CPI missed expectations.


### Coming up today

At 14.30, we have crude oil inventories.
