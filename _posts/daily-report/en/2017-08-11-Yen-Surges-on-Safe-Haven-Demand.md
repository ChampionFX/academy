### Morning Report: 07.00 London

The yen easing a little this morning after a surge in demand for traders looking for safe havens. The USD/JPY saw some of the biggest declines yesterday, alongside the AUD/JPY which is feeling the regional pinch. 

The dollar has been mixed as have the dollar pairs with no discernible trend over the last few days. Most dollar pairs are nudging higher after moderate losses yesterday. 

The big exceptions are the AUD/USD, which is trading lower again this morning and the NZD/USD which suffered severe losses yesterday. 

Gold is also off the pace after three days of gains. 

### Coming up today

Today we have minor European data in the morning. 

This is followed by US CPI at 13.30. 

Following this, FOMC member Kaplan speaks at 14.40, with member Kashkari speaking at 16.30.
