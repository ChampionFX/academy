### Morning Report: 07.00 London

The yen pairs are down again this morning as the yen itself remains firmly in control of currency movements. 

The USD/JPY and GBP/JPY have extended their losing streaks sparked by the May 11th turnaround, while other yen pairs such as the EUR/JPY and AUD/JPY are extending their more recent declines. 

The British pound is steady after heavy losses on Friday and follow on selling yesterday. 

The euro is trading in line with its peers after under performing yesterday. The EUR/GBP is unchanged after a reversal yesterday. 

Gold has a positive bias though as the precious metal seeks to rise on the back of continue dollar weakness. 

### Coming up today

Today, we have Canadian current account data at 13.30, released alongside RMPI. 

CB Consumer Confidence follows at 15.00.
