### Morning Report: 07.00 London

This morning, the US dollar is on the rise ahead of today's ADP payroll data. Numbers are expected to dip, but perhaps more importantly, manufacturing numbers are expected to rise. 

Meanwhile, the USD/JPY and other yen pairs are generally positive, with the exception of the AUD/JPY. 

The AUD/USD is struggling after three days of solid gains.
